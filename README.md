# Description
just mini basic javascript projects - only included 2 because i'm too tired to find the code for the rest of my projects. the candle one (for my create task) features a candle with a moving flame and shadow. it plays sungha jung's spirited away guitar music, can change the color of the flame and the size of the candle through user inputs. the second one is just an image filter. overall just very basic javascript, since this was the first time i coded in js.

# Context
projects i did over the summer of 2020 for atdp's apcsp class (so i don't have to take apcsp at school). kinda regret taking this class tho, because it was a little too underwhelming. more busy work than deep learning. imma go self-learn algorithms and data structures from now on. cant rely on classes, because they simply don't suit me.
